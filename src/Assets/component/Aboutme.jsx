            <p>I am a third-year computer science engineering student at Amity University. I have a strong passion
              for coding, software development, and Web Developemnt. Throughout my studies, I have gained a solid
              understanding of computer science fundamentals and have had the opportunity to apply these skills
              through various course projects and internships. <br />
              My coursework and internships have exposed me to a wide range of computer science disciplines,
              including computer architecture, data structures, algorithms, databases, and software engineering. I
              have also had the opportunity to work on several personal projects.</p>
